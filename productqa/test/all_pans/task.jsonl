{"id": "fact_qa_711", "question": "Is the Norpro 273 Broil/Roast Pan Set large enough to fit two decent-sized steaks at the same time?", "answer": "To answer whether the Norpro 273 Broil/Roast Pan Set is large enough to fit two decent-sized steaks at the same time, we need to know the size of the pan and the average size of decent-sized steaks.\n\nFrom the product information, the size of the pan is 8 inches. However, since the question is about fitting two steaks, we need to assume the size of the steaks. For the sake of this question, let's assume a decent-sized steak is about 6-8 inches in length.\n\nGiven the pan size is 8 inches and the steak size is 6-8 inches, it's likely that two steaks can fit in the pan, but it will be a tight fit. \n\nHowever, since the question isn't about the exact number of steaks that can fit, we can provide a more general answer based on the pan size. \n\nThe pan size is 8 inches, which is relatively small for broiling or roasting two decent-sized steaks at the same time.", "type": "fact_qa"}
